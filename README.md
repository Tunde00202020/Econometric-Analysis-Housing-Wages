# Econometric-Analysis-Housing-Wages
A comprehensive econometric analysis examining housing price determinants and wage structures using multiple regression models with Stata.


##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates econometric techniques to analyze:
- **Housing Markets**: Impact of location characteristics and property features on housing prices
- **Wage Determination**: Returns to education, experience, and their interactions in labor markets

## üìÅ Data Sources

This analysis uses built-in Stata datasets that come with the software installation:

- `kielmc.dta` - Housing prices and incinerator location (from Wooldridge)
- `wage1.dta` - Wage determination data  
- `wage2.dta` - Extended wage data
- `hprice1.dta` - Housing price data

**No additional data downloads required** - these datasets are automatically available in Stata via the `bcuse` command or are included in the standard Stata installation.

##  Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Econometric Modeling**: OLS regression, log-linear models, quadratic terms, interaction effects
- **Statistical Concepts**: Omitted variable bias, marginal effects, hypothesis testing
- **Data Analysis**: Data cleaning, model specification, result interpretation
- **Tools**: Stata, Statistical inference, Data visualization
